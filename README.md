# A long running project to create a club using Blockchain

This repository is an attempt to create a club where members can have certain
priviliges. Currently, the project has not defined those priviliges.
The original version has a simple way to connect a user and approve it by the
administrator. 

As the work moves on, Drizzle and other Truffle frameworks be used.

If you have ideas, please comment.
